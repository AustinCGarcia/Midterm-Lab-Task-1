# [Midterm Lab Task 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19072538/labtask1.xlsx)
This portfolio demonstrates the process of data normalization and cleaning applied to a transactional database. The dataset consists of multiple 
related tables, each designed to improve data organization and elimanate redundancy.

## Step-by-Step-Process

Step 1:
- Load the raw file
- Fix columns width and height
- TRIM words and spaces
- Remove null values
- Remove Duplicates

Step 2:
- Perform 1NF
- Perform Table split using 2NF
- Performed 2NF
- Mapped the normalization as a physical data model
